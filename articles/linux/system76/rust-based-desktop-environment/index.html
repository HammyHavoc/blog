<p>A few months ago System76 announced that they would be developing a new desktop environment based on the Rust programming language called <strong>COSMIC</strong>.</p>
<p>Their idea is to create a desktop environment that is similar to the one that is currently available for the Pop!_OS operating system, but with a different focus.</p>
<p>System76&rsquo;s objective is to create something that is faster, more customizable, and free of the limitations of the GNOME desktop environment, and let&rsquo;s face it, we&rsquo;re all curious as to how this desktop will look like.</p>
<p>This post will explore how this new desktop environment is shaping up.</p>
<h1 id=disclaimer>Disclaimer<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#disclaimer>#</a></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>The COSMIC desktop is still a work in progress and is not yet ready for use, most of what you&rsquo;ll see here is a preview and subject to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id=settings>Settings<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#settings>#</a></h1>
<p>As of right now, Pop!_OS uses GNOME Settings app but System76 is hard at work developing a new version of the settings app for the COSMIC desktop using GTK 4, here&rsquo;s a comparison between the two.</p>
<p><img src=/images/articles/linux/system76/rust-based-de/comparison.png alt=cosmic_settings title="COSMIC Settings: Left, GNOME Settings: Right"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some of the UI changes I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s no visible distinction between the window title bar and the body of the window.
<img src=/images/articles/linux/system76/rust-based-de/titlebar.png alt=titlebar title=Titlebar></li>
<li>The app is using rounded corners in the window and in elements inside the app, exactly at 12px.</li>
<li>The interface is styled using CSS.</li>
<li>The navigation view can be collapsed using the <code>Navigation</code> button at the top left corner.
<img src=/images/articles/linux/system76/rust-based-de/collapsed.png alt=collapsed title=Collapsed></li>
<li>The toggle buttons are now using the same color as the navigation view.</li>
<li>The search bar is available everywhere in the app.
<img src=/images/articles/linux/system76/rust-based-de/search.png alt=search title=Search></li>
</ul>
<h2 id=search>Search<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#search>#</a></h2>
<p>One of the biggest changes is the search feature, in GNOME Settings, the search bar is available at the top of the navigation view, this is problematic when inside nested menus as the user has to go back to the begining to access it, but in COSMIC it&rsquo;s available everywhere in the app, no matter how deep inside a menu the user is.</p>
<h3 id=settings-at-a-glance>Settings at a glance<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#settings-at-a-glance>#</a></h3>
<p>The search also displays a list of all the settings that match the search criteria and not only where they&rsquo;re located as GNOME Settings does, this makes it easier to change your settings without having to leave the section you currently are in.</p>
<p><img src=/images/articles/linux/system76/rust-based-de/search_comparison.png alt=search_comparison title="Search Comparison"></p>
<h1 id=launcher>Launcher<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#launcher>#</a></h1>
<p>There is already a working version of Pop Launcher, it&rsquo;s built using GTK.</p>
<p><img src=/images/articles/linux/system76/rust-based-de/new_launcher.png alt=new_launcher title="New Launcher"></p>
<p>The new launcher is fairly similar to the one that is currently available for the Pop!_OS.</p>
<p><img src=/images/articles/linux/system76/rust-based-de/launcher.png alt=launcher title=Launcher></p>
<p>There aren&rsquo;t any major changes, but there are some minor ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>The launcher is a bit smaller and more compact.</li>
<li>The launcher selection indicator has a yellow border around it as opposed to the grey one already present in the current launcher.
<img src=/images/articles/linux/system76/rust-based-de/launcher_selection.png alt=launcher_selection title="Launcher Selection"></li>
</ul>
<p>I found a small bug where if you selected an application and then return to search something else the launcher would panic, an <a href=https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic/issues/9>issue</a> has been filled.</p>
<h1 id=app-library>App Library<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#app-library>#</a></h1>
<p>Pop!_OS recently received an <a href=https://blog.system76.com/post/670564272872488960/popos-2110-has-landed>update</a> to the App Library where instead of opening in fullscreen, the app is opened in a floating window.</p>
<p><img src=/images/articles/linux/system76/rust-based-de/app_library.png alt=app_library title="App Library"></p>
<p>COSMIC will is also have an app library, but it will be built using GTK.</p>
<p><img src=/images/articles/linux/system76/rust-based-de/new_app_library.png alt=new_app_library title="New App Library"></p>
<p>We can notice that the new app library is very similar to the one that is currently available for the Pop!_OS, the only difference I could notice was the use of colored folder icons.</p>
<p>As expected, there are some bugs present and some features missing, after all this is still a work in progress.</p>
<p>I found a small bug where if you try to navigate the app grid with the keyboard, it opens the second app it selects, an <a href=https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic/issues/8>issue</a> has been filled.</p>
<h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h1>
<p>This is the first step towards creating a new desktop environment, there&rsquo;s no doubt that there are many things that will be improved. this is just the beginning.</p>
<p>I hope that this article gives you an idea of what the future of the COSMIC desktop will be like.</p>
